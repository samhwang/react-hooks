# Sam's React hooks collection

React hooks that I have seen over the years, all packed up in a repo for easier future reference.

## Contents

- `useWindowSize`: A hook that will calculate the window view size.
- `useToggle`: A simple boolean state toggler hook.

## Usage

Go to the `release` branch and click on the folder of the hook you want to use. There
should be a `TS` version and a `JS` version of each one.
